# System Analysis and Design

Development lifecycle models shows the system analysis process and describes what happens at each stage of the development lifecycle
There are a number of different development lifecycles such as:
* Waterfall model
* Spiral model
* Rapid Application Development (RAD) / Agile development model
* V-shaped model
* Incremental model

### Waterfall
The waterfall model includes tasks which cascade downwards as shown in the image on the right.

This is normally used for long term projects

Another feature of this model is that there is no turning back to tasks, just as how water flows down a ‘waterfall’, it does not go up.

This means that when one task is completed it cannot be revised.

Benefits | Weaknesses
---------|------
Is easy to understand and easy to use as it is sequential | The requirements must be well defined as all the other phases depend on this; there is no turning back
Provides a structure where the milestones are well defined | There are no iterations, therefore there is not as much problem solving as software development requires
Progress can be effectively tracked which is good for management | 

### Spiral
